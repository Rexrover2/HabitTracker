# Habit Tracker Web Application

Check out the deployed website [here](https://habit-tracker-a92f9.web.apps/)!

A personal side project inspired by Simone Giertz's Everyday Calendar 
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simonegiertz/the-every-day-calendar

I am embarking on this to gain a more sound fullstack experience in technologies and practices such as - 
    
## Backend:
- PostgreSQL, 
- Routes and controllers for Rest APIs
- Postman
- Express
- Node
- Firebase for authentication (with firebase's JWT token)
- methods for protecting against SQL injection 
    
## Middleware:
- Axios for consuming REST APIs (+ interceptors for JWT verification).
        
## Frontend:
- React
- Aysnchronous programming
- React-router 
- Semantic-UI
- React Date Picker
- React-Hexagon
- React-Hook-Form
- User auth provided by Firebase
        
## Hosting:
- Firebase (frontend and server)
- AWS RDS (PostgreSQL database)

## CI/CD
